# Subsampled Bi-Transformer & Packed-Ensemble Surrogate Models for Flow Estimation Arround Airfoil Geometries

This repository shows two different model strategies adapted from Transformers [[1]](#1) and Packed-Ensembles [[2]](#2) for solving the RANS equations, based on the LIPS framework [[3]](#3) and the Airfrans Dataset [[4]](#4).

The study provided here is part of the ML4physim challenge hosted by IRT-Systemx (see [Codabench page](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/1534/)).
CFD simulations being very costly, the use of data-driven surrogate models can be useful to optimize the shape of airfoils without paying the cost of expensive simulations.

Two families of models were implemented and tested here:
- **Subsampled Bi-Transformer models:** which are modified version of transformer networks, where for each simulations, the query tokens are only attended to a subsampled set of key tokens from the pointcloud of the simulation which we call the skeleton of the mesh. The best model's implementation is locateed in the `subsampled_bi_transformers/bi_transformer` folder, and can be ran using the `run.py` file.
- **Packed-ensemble models:** Packed Ensembles are generalizations of Deep-ensembles that allow to lower the number of a classical ensemble model's parameters. For Packed-Ensembles, two frameworks are proposed in the `packed_ensembles` folder:
    - A complete and independent framework developped in `ml4science.ipynb` with a custom training function and a cross validation selection implementation.
    - An implementation of the Packed-Ensemble model within the LIPS framework in `packed_lips.ipynb`. All the configurations that were tried are explicited in the `config.ini` file.


The Bi-transformer model got us the $4^{\text{th}}$ place in this challenge!


Also, feel free to checkout the `checkpoint` branch to see other model tests and implementations.

## Installation

### Install the LIPS framework

#### Setup an Environment

```commandline
conda create --name ml4science python=3.9
```

##### Create a virtual environment

##### Enter virtual environment
```commandline
conda activate ml4science

```commandline
cd src
git clone https://github.com/IRT-SystemX/LIPS.git
```
Then remove the `numpy` and `scipy` requirement from the `setup.py` file to avoid conflicts.

```commandline
cd LIPS
pip install -U .
cd ..
```
